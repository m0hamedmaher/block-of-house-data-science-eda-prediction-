Title: My Recent Project on Housing Data Analysis

I'm excited to share a project I recently completed during my internship at Creativa Institute. I worked on a dataset called "housing" which involves calculating the median house value for blocks of houses. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I did:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed in-depth EDA to understand the patterns and distributions within the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: I preprocessed the data using powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to clean and prepare it for analysis.

Tools & Technologies:

NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization to uncover insights.
Scikit-learn: For preprocessing and model implementation.
Project Outcome: The processed data and insights have been crucial for further analysis and modeling, contributing significantly to understanding housing trends.

This project was a great learning experience, enhancing my skills in data analysis and preprocessing. I'm looking forward to applying these skills in future projects!
